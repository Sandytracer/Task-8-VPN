# Task-8-VPN
# 🔐 Task 8 – VPN Setup and Privacy Analysis using ProtonVPN

## 📘 Objective
The main goal of this task was to understand **how a Virtual Private Network (VPN)** helps protect privacy, secure internet connections, and ensure safe online browsing.  
I used **ProtonVPN (Free Version)** to explore how it hides IP addresses, encrypts traffic, and prevents online tracking or hacking attempts.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 🥇 Step 1: Choosing a VPN Service
I selected **ProtonVPN** because:
- It’s created by the same team behind **ProtonMail**, known for strong privacy.
- It uses **AES-256 encryption** to protect all user data.
- It has a **no-log policy**, ensuring browsing history isn’t stored.
- The **free version** has **no data limits**, which is rare and useful for testing.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Download and Installation
1. Visited the [official ProtonVPN website](https://protonvpn.com/).
2. Signed up for a **free account** using my email.
3. Downloaded and installed the **Windows VPN client**.
4. Logged in using my account credentials.

---

### 🌐 Step 3: Connecting to a VPN Server
- Clicked **“Quick Connect”** to automatically connect to the nearest fast server.
- After connection, the app displayed:
  - A **new IP address**
  - The **connected country**
- This confirmed that the VPN connection was active and working correctly.

---

### 🕵️ Step 4: Checking My IP Address
1. Checked my **original IP** using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) before connecting.
2. After connecting to ProtonVPN, refreshed the page — the **IP and location changed**.
3. This proved that my internet traffic was being routed securely through the VPN server.

---

### 🔒 Step 5: Testing Encrypted Browsing
- Opened multiple sites like **Google** and **YouTube**.
- Browsing worked normally — confirming that data was encrypted.
- Verified that traffic was securely tunneled through ProtonVPN.

---

### 🔁 Step 6: Disconnecting and Comparing
- After disconnecting the VPN, my **IP reverted** to my real one.
- Observed a **slight speed reduction** while using the VPN — normal due to encryption overhead.

| State | IP | Speed | Notes |
|--------|----|--------|-------|
| Without VPN | Real IP | Normal | Direct connection |
| With VPN | Changed IP | Slightly slower | Encrypted traffic |

### 🧠 Step 7: Learning About VPN Security
During research, I discovered:
- **AES-256-bit encryption** for high security.
- Supports **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** protocols.
- Includes a **Kill Switch** feature to stop traffic on sudden disconnection.
- Protects from **DNS leaks**, keeping real IP hidden.

### ✅ Step 8: VPN Benefits and Limitations

#### **Benefits**
- Hides real IP and location.
- Encrypts browsing data for privacy.
- Protects users on public Wi-Fi.
- Enables access to blocked/restricted websites.
- Prevents tracking by ISPs or websites.

#### **Limitations**
- Slightly slower browsing speed.
- Limited free servers available.
- Not 100% anonymous (VPN provider manages servers).
- Some platforms block VPN connections.

## 🧾 Outcome
- Learned to **set up and use ProtonVPN** effectively.  
- Verified **IP change** and **data encryption** in real-time.  
- Understood the **importance of encryption** and **privacy tools** in cybersecurity.  
- Gained **hands-on experience** with a real-world VPN.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **ProtonVPN (Free Version)**
- **Windows OS**
- **whatismyipaddress.com**

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrated the practical use of VPNs for secure, private internet browsing.  
It helped me understand **how encryption, IP masking, and secure tunneling** combine to protect online privacy — a crucial concept in modern **cybersecurity**.
